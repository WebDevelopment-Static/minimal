# Is Amazon Interested on Cryptocurrency? 
Recently Jeff Bezos, founder, chairman, president and CEO of Amazon, Inc., meet secretly with Ripple's CEO and CFO, to discuss the integration of Ripple's cryptocurrency XRP, to the gigants retailer's India and South America. This will mean the true acceptance of cryptocurrency by everyone and can re-shape the financial markets. It would not be the first time Jeff Bezos changes the world. (We have reach out to Amazon, and Ripple, neither company have responded) 

# The L train latest News, is nothing other than a political stance from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, who is planning a presidential run or he wishes. 

Cuomo lies to the press and public with his announcement on January 3rd 2019, he claimed a new plan was in place to fix the tunnels on the L train, without shutting off the system as originally designed. Furthermore, his announcement resulted in the forceful resignation of the head of construction for the MTA Capital Construction John O'Grady, who is the SVP since 2015 and worked 31 years and has had an impecable track record. We have evidence Cuomo, never had another license Civil Structural Engineer, to review the project, contrarian to his announcement on January 3rd, 2019. NY Governor, Andrew Cuomo, rather took the word of a Civil Engineer, who never visited nor saw the structural plans of the L Line Project. "We know what got reported yesterday, by Andrew Cuomo is not physically workable or possible" said a Civil Structural Engineer, who has worked on the project for the past years, and ask to remain anonymous. This is nothing other than a political stance from a politician who will do anything to gain attention, 
he continued, we are speachless and sad to learn the abrupt departure of the head of MTA construction John O'Grady, but he is an honorable men, and will never act outside his engineering duties nor will jepardize the publics safety or taxpayers dollars. (this storty will be updated when more information is available)

## Bittrex, is being accused of running a ponzi scheme. Is this another billion dollars fraud!?

The cryptocurrency exchange hired former US Homland Security Employees soon after the company got accused in 2017 of commiting fraud by locking and using investors money without any legal right. In 2018, the company continued to use investors money in violatation of United States Federal Laws, and a class action is in progress and soon to be entered in the New York Court system. Some of the claims prove Bittrex knew they were breaking the law and did little or nothing to correct the misappropriation of investors funds.


### The International Rescue Committee (Rescue.org) got accused and confirmed of sourcing pharmaceutical from inside Syria in 2014-2015 in violation of United States Federal Laws. The breach which jeopardizes the health of those who are in most need, refugees in a war zone, paid the price. How will you like to be given anesthesia altered with water and in the middle of surgery you walk up? The international Rescue Committee lost $300MM, in funding from the federal fund USAID, but the people responsible for such a betrayal were never brought to justice (we have the emails)

While the Senior Vice President and Head of Supply Chain, who is part of the Leadership Team of the Foundation, reporting directly to David Miliband and Madeleine Sadler, was never fired, many directors oversees got fired for this occurrence and got blamed for following their boss orders and advice.
