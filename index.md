# The L train latest News, is nothing other than a political stance from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, who is planning a presidential run or he wishes. 

Cuomo lies to the press and public with his announcement on January 3rd 2019, he claimed a new plan was in place to fix the tunnels on the L train, without shutting off the system as originally designed. Furthermore, his announcement resulted in the forceful resignation of the head of construction for the MTA Capital Construction John O'Grady, who is the SVP since 2015 and worked 31 years with pristine track record. We have evidence Cuomo, never had another license Civil Structural Engineer to review the project, contrarian to his announcement on January 3rd, 2019. NY Governor, Andrew Cuomo, rather took the word of a Civil Engineer, who never visited nor saw the structural plans of the L Line Project. "We know what got reported yesterday, by Andrew Cuomo is not physically workable or possible, the work will be three times more expensive and most likely unsafe for the workers and commuters" said a Civil Structural Engineer, who has worked on the project for the past years, and ask to remain anonymous. "This is nothing other than a political stance from a politician who will do anything to gain attention, he continued, we are speechless and sad to learn the abrupt departure of the head of MTA construction John O'Grady, but he is an honorable men, and will never act outside his engineering duties nor will jeopardize the publics safety or taxpayers dollars" (this story will be updated when more information is available)

In 2018, the company continued to use investors money in violatation of United States Federal Laws, and a class action is in progress and soon to be entered in the New York Court system.
