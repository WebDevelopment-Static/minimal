# Is Amazon Interested in Cryptocurrency? 
We have an information that Jeff Bezos, founder, chairman, president and CEO of Amazon, Inc., meet secretly with Ripple's CEO and CFO, to discuss the integration of Ripple's cryptocurrency XRP, to the gigants retailer's India and South America market. This will mean the true acceptance of cryptocurrency and can re-shape the financial markets. It would not be the first time that Bezos revolutionazes the world. (We have reach out to Bezos, and Ripple but neither company have responded) 

# The L train latest News, is nothing other than a political stance from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, who is planning a presidential run or he wishes. 

We have information, Cuomo lies to the press and public with his announcement yesterday, January 3rd 2019, a new plan was in place to fix the tunnels on the L train line, without shutting the system. Furthermore, his plan resulted in the forceful resignation of the head of construction John O'Grady, with 31 years at MTA of an impecable track record. We have evidence Cuomo, never had another license Civil Structural Engineer, to review the project, contrain to what he stated. Instead Cuomo, rather took the word of a Civil Engineer, who never visited nor saw the structural plans of the L Line Project. "We know what got reported yesterday, by Andrew Cuomo, is not physically workable or possible" said a Civil Structural Engineer, who has worked on the project for the past years, and ask to remain anonymous. This is nothing other than a political stance from a politician who will do anything to gain attention, 
he continued, we are speachless and sad to learn the abrupt departure of the head of MTA construction John O'Grady, but he is an honorable men, and will never act outside his engineering duties  nor his respect for taxpayers dollars. (this storty will be updated when more information is available)

## Bittrex, is being accused of running a ponzi scheme. Is this another billion dollars fraud!?

The cryptocurrency exchange hired former US Homland Security Employees soon after the company got accused in 2017 of commiting fraud by locking and using investors money without any legal right. In 2018, the company continued to use investors money in violatation of United States Federal Laws, and a class action is in progress and soon to be entered in the New York Court system. Some of the claims prove Bittrex knew they were breaking the law and did little or nothing to correct the misappropriation of investors funds.


### The International Rescue Committee (Rescue.org) got accused and confirmed of sourcing pharmaceutical from inside Syria in 2014-2015 in violation of United States Federal Laws. The breach which jeopardizes the health of those who are in most need, refugees in a war zone, paid the price. How will you like to be given anesthesia altered with water and in the middle of surgery you walk up? The international Rescue Committee lost $300MM, in funding from the federal fund USAID, but the people responsible for such a betrayal were never brought to justice (we have the emails)

While the Senior Vice President and Head of Supply Chain, who is part of the Leadership Team of the Foundation, reporting directly to David Miliband and Madeleine Sadler, was never fired, many directors oversees got fired for this occurrence and got blamed for following their boss orders and advice.
