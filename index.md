# Bittrex, is being accused of running a ponzi scheme. 
The cryptocurrency exchange has hired former US Homland Security Employees soon after the company got accused in 2017. In 2018 the company has continue to use investors money in violatation of United States Federal Laws and a class action is in progress and soon to be entered in the New York Court system. 


# The International Rescue Committee (Rescue.org) who was accused of sourcing pharma from inside syria in 2015 and lost $300MM in funding from USAID, never fired the Senior Vice President who gave the order (we have the emails)

While the Senior Vice President who reports directly to David Milliband and Madeline, was never fired despite of the fraud commited. Many directors oversees got fired for this occurance but the people who force the actions never got repremended or expose. We are about to change that.
